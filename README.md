# Toshiba-Workflow-Optimization

The purpose of this project is to redo the front-end retail checkout process to keep up with technology and process improvements that are changing the customer experience. The goal is to accommodate to customer demographics according to their individual needs and behaviors through the group’s alignment with the target market.

### About
Everyone asks, “Well, why should I care?” The answer is simple. When is the last time you bought groceries or stocked up on products at BJ’s or CostCo? Did you wait in line too long? Were there not enough lanes open? Were you frustrated that an employee wasn’t available when you needed help in self checkout?
These are frustrations we all have when we shop, and we all shop for groceries, toiletries and other items on a weekly basis. But going to the store shouldn’t be a difficult or time consuming process. Because of that, we are focused on improving the three following objectives: 

•	Improve customer experience through a frictionless shopping experience 

•	Reallocating labor efficiently to optimize customer experience 

•	Improving loss prevention methods
